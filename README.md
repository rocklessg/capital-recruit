# CapitalRecruit

This wep api project was developed with .NET 8. It aimed at bridging the interaction between Employer/Recruiter and a Candidate/Applicant.
The employer create a form (with question templates as he chooses) to be later fill by the applicant (Candidate) and save to the database.

In this project, I demonstrated;
- The use of SOLID principle for my code modularity, reusability and flexibility.
- The use of dependency injection.
- Abstraction of some configurations out of program.cs class for code cleaness.
- Use of NoSql CosmosDb
- Use of Generic repository to avoid repeatication of common CRUD operations
- Unit test to ensure application features reliability.
- Security in not exposing sensitive information withing the code base.
- Clean architecture implementation.
- Tactical comments to explain my reasoning Why I implemented certain logics in certain way.

# Tools used
- Azure Cosmos DB emulator.
- X Unit test
- .NET 8
- Entity Framework core
- Postman

# Project limitation
There are other good stuffs I didn't cover in this project due to time constrain such as;
- Loggings
- Global exception handling
- Authentication and Authorization to mention but few.
  
# What I learned
My main take away in this project is having frontend developers in mind every step of my designing and implementations, it made me think on both ends not only on the backend. 
Thank you for this oppotunity.
